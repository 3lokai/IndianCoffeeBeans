  "description": "<p>From a partner farm that prides itself on sustainable irrigation practices, and whose name translates to \"a string of blessings\", here's a versatile coffee with a balanced flavour profile. </p>\n<p>Processed using the honey sun-dried method, this medium roast has an aroma that hints at berries and honey. The lush, creamy mouthfeel reveals notes of peach, pomelo, and honey, while a light aftertaste of mosambi lingers. </p>\n<p>With low bitterness and a harmonious balance of sweetness and acidity, it makes for a great cup for diverse palates. Our roasters recommend brewing it as an espresso, a Pour Over, or using an AeroPress. </p>\n<p>It works well black as well as in milk-based recipes.</p>",
