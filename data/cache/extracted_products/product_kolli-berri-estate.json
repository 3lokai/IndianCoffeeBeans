  "description": "<p>Our first coffee from Harvest ‘24 is a medium-dark roast with chocolatey and nutty flavours. This single-origin <strong>ground coffee</strong> hails from the beautiful Kolli Berri Estate, set in Chikmagalur, Karnataka. </p>\n<p>While brewing this one, you’ll notice the unique characteristics of the <strong>coffee beans</strong>, starting with the aroma of dried fruits, followed by a syrupy mouthfeel in every sip. With medium acidity and medium- high bitterness, it offers a full-bodied profile which is enhanced when brewed as an espresso or using an AeroPress, Moka Pot or a French Press. </p>\n<!---->",
