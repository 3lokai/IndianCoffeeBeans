  "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We are thrilled to present our first ever single origin dark roast, with <strong>coffee beans</strong> sourced from a new partner farm— Estate in Chikmagalur, Karnataka. </p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This coffee has a journey of rich, complex flavours that will leave you craving for more. As you take a sip, enjoy the velvety mouthfeel reminiscent of dark chocolate, which enhances the overall richness of this brew. The coffee’s body is heavy and round, creating a luscious and full-bodied experience that envelops your palate. If you’ve liked our dark roasts like <strong>Vienna</strong> and <strong>Dhak</strong>, you’ll love this one! <br>The Basankhan Estate is a family-owned farm located in Chikmagalur, Karnataka with a rich history spanning over 100 years. In addition to coffee, the estate cultivates other crops such as black pepper, oranges, cardamom, lemons, and bananas.</p>",
