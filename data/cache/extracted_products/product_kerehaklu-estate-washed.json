  "description": "<p>A delicate and complex favourite, sourced from one of our longest-standing partners, has returned! We've roasted it light, so you can craft clean cups that really bring out the inherent flavour of the coffee beans.  </p>\n<p>It opens with a sweet, honey-like aroma, easing you gently into the first sip. The soft, delicate body comes soon after, with the bright and citrusy mouthfeel delivering a pleasant punch. Expect low bitterness and medium-high acidity in your brew, and notes of peach, mosambi, and black tea, with the last one lingering a while. </p>\n<p>The perfect companion to moments of quiet, or pleasantly slow mornings, our roasters recommend brewing it black, either as a pour over, or using an AeroPress.</p>\n<!---->",
