  "description": "<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This nano-lot from Baarbara Estate was produced by adding yeast to the ripened cherries in a controlled environment. The fermentation process results in notes of candied fruits and berries in the cup with a prominent acidity and complexity.</span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This is the first year we experiment with yeast fermentation. For this lot, we chose a yeast called Intenso (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), intended to increase fruity flavours, mouthfeel and general cup quality.</span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We found a floral aroma and notes of pomegranate, cherry, candied fruit and a hints of prunes supported by a smooth mouthfeel and the best way to enjoy this is to either brew a pour over or an iced coffee.</span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We have cupped this coffee multiple times in different stages of harvest and roast profiles. It can be strange and puzzling (in a nice way) because the flavours are constantly developing. It's like watching your favourite movie, that you've forgotten.</span><br></p>\n<p>Origin - Single Origin<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Altitude - 4500 ft - 5000 ft<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Varietal - SLN 795<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Roasted for - Filter<br></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best brewed as -Pour Over and Iced Coffees<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taste Notes - Pomegranate, Cherry, Candied Fruit &amp; Prunes</span></p>\n<p><em><!----></em></p>",
