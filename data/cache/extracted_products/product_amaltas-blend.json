  "description": "<p>An ode to the vibrant burst of yellow that marks the beginning of Indian summers, this blend is our go-to choice for crafting a refreshing batch of coffee including cold brews. In fact, this was originally called the Cold Bold Blend but owing to its diversity (its flavours shine through in a Pour Over or Aeropress), we decided to rename it after one of our favourite neighbourhood trees. </p>\n<p>A blend of washed and natural processed coffees, we’ve roasted it light to accentuate fruity and refreshing citrus notes. The result? Balanced cups with notes of blueberry and milk chocolate, with each sip concluding with a chocolatey finish.  </p>\n<p>This light and fruity favourite is best enjoyed black.</p>",
