### Phase 5: Frontend Integration

- [] Build Framer-based frontend to consume enriched Supabase data
- [] Expose coffee detail pages, filters, and search
- [] Add attribution for Crawl4AI and DeepSeek

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate To-Do:

1. **Test Full Pipeline End-to-End**
   - Run with multiple roasters to verify stability
   - Test with large product catalogs to ensure scalability
   - Verify database integration with Supabase

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze bottlenecks in the extraction pipeline
   - Fine-tune concurrent execution parameters
   - Optimize DeepSeek API usage and costs

3. **Error Handling & Resilience**
   - Implement more advanced retry mechanisms
   - Add detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - Create validation checks for extracted data

### Future Improvements:

1. **Implement Streaming Pipeline**  
   - Modify discovery to yield batches
   - Process products immediately through extraction
   - Support parallel processing of multiple roasters
   - Maintain memory efficiency for large datasets

2. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Create scheduled runs for regular data updates
   - Implement monitoring and alerts for failures

3. **Vector Search System**
   - Vectorize the DeepSeek enriched markdown files
   - Build a ChromaDB vector store for semantic search
   - Implement a Streamlit interface for natural language queries
   - Enable users to ask questions about coffee flavor profiles, brewing methods, and regional characteristics

## üèÜ Key Achievements

- **Platform-Aware Description Extraction**: Successfully implemented intelligent path prioritization based on platform detection
- **Multi-Source Description Processing**: Created a scoring system that selects the best description from multiple sources
- **Test Suite**: Built comprehensive testing framework with real-world and mock test cases
- **Caching System**: Implemented efficient caching to minimize redundant network requests
- **Schema.org Support**: Added structured data extraction for better metadata quality
- **Discovery Framework**: Created a flexible, multi-strategy system for product discovery
- **AI-Enhanced Extraction**: Implemented DeepSeek LLM fallback for missing attributes
- **Modular Architecture**: Created a clean, extensible codebase with separation of concerns
- **Unified Pipeline**: Developed complete orchestration from discovery to database upload

## üêû Known Issues

- Founded year detection is only successful in 1 of 8 real-world tests
- Social media extraction fails for some sites (Subko, Naivo)
- Some console logging issues with Unicode emoji characters on Windows
- Need to verify handling of pagination for large product catalogs
- DeepSeek API usage needs to be monitored for cost management
- Concurrent execution may need tuning for specific environment constraints
- Pagination check ‚Äì Mention specific platforms (Shopify /products.json?page=X, Woo /wc/v3/products?page=X)
- DeepSeek cost tracking ‚Äì Maybe consider caching enriched markdowns to avoid re-hitting the API

## üí° Ideas & Future Improvements

- Add a web interface to monitor scraping progress
- Consider implementing retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Add support for multi-language product descriptions
- Create a vector RAG system from the markdown files of each coffee and roaster for AI-based search
- Implement distributed processing for handling very large roaster lists
- Add image analysis to extract more data from product images
- Develop a data quality monitoring system to track extraction success over time
- Create a recommendation engine based on extracted flavor profiles
