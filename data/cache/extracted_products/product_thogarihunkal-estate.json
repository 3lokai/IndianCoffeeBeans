  "description": "<p>Start your day with the sweet aromas of toffee from our newest harvest from Thogarihunkal Estate. This delicious medium roast, with flavours of brown sugar, green grape and roasted almond, tastes great when taken black or with a little bit of milk. This coffee was processed using the washed method, developing the <strong>coffee beans</strong> to have a clean flavour profile with low acidity and bitterness, and a sweet, long aftertaste of honey and raisins. You can enjoy the smooth, buttery mouthfeel of this medium-bodied coffee by brewing it as an Espresso or a Pour Over, or by using other manual brewing methods.Â </p>",
