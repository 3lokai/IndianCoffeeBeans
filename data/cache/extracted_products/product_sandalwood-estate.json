  "description": "<p>This perennial coffee from 2023's harvest, Sandalwood Estate, is delicious with tasting notes of rich dark chocolate, sweet prune and zesty orange marmalade. This washed coffee, with <strong>coffee beans</strong> of the Sarchimor variety, was grown at a lush coffee estate in Coorg. If you’ve tried our coffees from <strong>Attikan and Baarbara Estates</strong>, you’ll love the chocolatey flavour profile of this medium-dark roast. This heavy bodied coffee has a smooth, syrupy mouthfeel which can best be enjoyed when brewed as an Espresso, pour over or using an AeroPress, Moka Pot or French Press. The long, sweet aftertaste of butter biscuits and dried fruit come through beautifully when you allow the brew to cool down a little.  </p>",
