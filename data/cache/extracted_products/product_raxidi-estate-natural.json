  "description": "<p>Our partnership with Raxidi Estate, a coffee farm run by three generations of the Lobo family since the 1950s, begins with an experimental anaerobic natural. </p>\n<p>To shape this micro lot into a cup with remarkable depth, handpicked coffee cherries were washed and placed in stainless steel containers, where they underwent a 20-hour anaerobic fermentation. Once fermented, the cherries were carefully dried on raised beds for 21 days, with temperature and humidity carefully monitored. </p>\n<p>Roasted light, the resulting brew opens with the aroma of prunes and black raisin, and notes of plum, raspberry, and mosambi. The mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy with a medium body, and finishing each sip is the sweet aftertaste of plum.  </p>\n<p>Best enjoyed black, we recommend brewing this coffee using an AeroPress, or as a Pour Over.</p>",
