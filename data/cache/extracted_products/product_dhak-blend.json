  "description": "<p>Our<strong> Dhak Blend</strong> is an ode to one of our favorite Indian trees with its colorful flame-like flowers that signal the onset of Spring. The coffees used in this blend are naturally processed which means that the <strong>coffee beans</strong> are dried with the cherry, resulting in complex, fruity and sweet flavours.</p>\n<p>Roasted dark to bring out flavours of dark chocolate and fruit jam, this blend's heavy cocoa body leaves a smooth lingering aftertaste.</p>\n<p>Our roasting team recommends the Dhak Blend for espresso-based drinks as well as manual brews such as the Moka Pot and the French Press.</p>",
